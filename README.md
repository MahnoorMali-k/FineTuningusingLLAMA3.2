# Fine-Tuning LLAMA 3.2 Using QLoRA and LoRA Techniques

This project demonstrates how to fine-tune the LLAMA 3.2 language model using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation) and LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) techniques. These methods are designed to optimize large language models, making them more efficient and resource-friendly while maintaining or improving performance.

## Key Features
- **LLAMA 3.2 Model**: Utilizes the latest LLAMA 3.2 architecture for advanced NLP tasks.
- **QLoRA**: Efficient quantization for low memory usage and faster model training.
- **LoRA**: Low-rank adaptation technique to specialize a pre-trained model on specific tasks with minimal resources.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Tailors the LLAMA model to specific applications without retraining from scratch.
- **Scalable**: Demonstrates how to apply QLoRA and LoRA on large-scale models effectively, even on limited hardware.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Load and preprocess the dataset specific to your fine-tuning task.
   - Ensure the dataset is formatted correctly for input to the LLAMA 3.2 model.

2. **Model Fine-Tuning**:
   - Use QLoRA for efficient quantization to reduce memory usage.
   - Apply LoRA to adapt the pre-trained LLAMA 3.2 model to your specific task.

3. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the fine-tuned model using task-specific metrics to ensure performance improvements.
