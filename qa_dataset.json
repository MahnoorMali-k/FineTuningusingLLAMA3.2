        "output": "The principles reiterated in the Court of Appeal decision in HJFG v KCY (CACV 127/2011) concerning maintenance pending suit/interim maintenance applications are that the sole criteria to be applied in determining the application is \"reasonable\" which is synonymous with \"fairness\".

Sound legal advice is desirable to ensure that a party understands the implications of the agreement. Full disclosure of any assets owned by the other party may be necessary, although if it's clear that a party is fully aware of the implications and indifferent to the particulars, there may be no need to accord the agreement reduced weight due to unawareness of those particulars.

It is required that there should be some \"special or unusual feature\" in the case for costs to be awarded on an indemnity basis. Factors such as the reasonableness of the parties' conduct and any oppressive or vexatious behavior also need to be taken into account."

This principle implies that parents should not be deterred from putting cases concerning children before the courts. This argument is supported by cases such as R v R (Costs and Child Case) [1997] 2 FLR 95, Re G (Costs:  Child Case) [1999] 2 FLR 250, and H v H, (unreported, CACV 42/2002, 6 September, 2002)."

Therefore, the principle of no costs order as a starting point in children's cases does not necessarily apply.

The principle of \"costs to follow the event\" is no longer the prescribed usual order but is instead just an option. The court is entitled to take into account all the circumstances of the case, including the conduct of all the parties, to make such order as it thinks fit.

In such cases, there would be no room left for the application of any sharing principle. The needs of the parties may absorb more than half of the total assets and \"needs\" become determinative. If the assets are meager, a \"clean break\" may not be possible and it may be necessary to have recourse to an order for periodical payments (Ref: paragraph 74, section 7 exercise)."

She insists that provisions should be made now for the son's future university education, expecting it to cost around HK$200,000 for four years of fees and expenses. She further believes that any future claims against the Husband for the son's financial assistance are likely to be futile, considering that the Husband has settled in Thailand and the only known asset he has within the jurisdiction is his share of the funds in court."

One method is through a Mesher order, where the house is settled on trust for sale with the sale postponed until the youngest child reaches a certain age. This was discussed in the case of Mesher v Mesher and Hall (Note) [1980] 1 All ER 126.

        "output": "According to s11 (1) and (7) of the Matrimonial Proceedings and Property Ordinance, Cap.192, the court has the power to vary or discharge the order, or to suspend any provision thereof temporarily and revive the operation of any provision so suspended.

        "output": "The modern approach, as required by section 11(7), is for the Court to consider all the circumstances of the case. The court is not required to proceed from the starting point of the original order but look at the matter afresh. Any change in any of the matters to which the Court was required to consider when making the original order was one of the circumstances to be considered."

        "output": "The husband's case is based on the argument that there has been a material change of circumstances, including his retirement, diminished income, remarriage, two young children from the second marriage, and the financial independence of his first wife and children from the first marriage. The husband thus asks for the children’s maintenance to be stopped as from the date of this hearing and the establishment of the Education Fund to be set aside."

        "output": "The husband's responsibility to pay the children's maintenance ends at the completion of their present university degrees. If the children decide to pursue further studies after that, they have to find their own way to do it. The husband's future liability towards B after that date would be restricted to 2 years only, ie. HK$408,000. For J, the husband has to pay another HK$612,000. This is based on the judgment from FCMC 5366/2008 (Paragraphs 37, 41, 42)."

The use of the Education Fund was restricted to the payment for \"school or university tuition fees\" of the children. No provision in the 2nd AR Order set aside the establishment of this Education Fund. The husband should still be responsible for the children's future university tuition fees. The Education Fund should be reduced to £70,000 to cater for the children's university tuition fees for the coming 3 to 4 years (Paragraphs 46, 47, 48)."
